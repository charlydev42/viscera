[Music] hi and welcome back today we are going to design an audio effect rack that can turn any sound into plastic rubber latex however you want to call it by simply employing a handful of Ableton vocoders and Max for live [Music] lfos this is a simple drum loop I made which we will be using throughout the process however you may use any sample of your heart desire for best results just make sure it's loud and covers a wide range of frequencies I have uploaded the drum Loop onto Google drive

along with a mini sample pack filled with sounds made from the audio effect rack we are making today go wild go crazy with it I love you oooo first on an audio track bring in a vocoder under the audio a effects Tab and name it vocoder 1 toggle the enhance button then under the carrier Chooser drop-down menu select pitch tracking then maximize the pitch detection range by dragging the upper pitch detection slider all the way up and the lower pitch detection slider all the way down after that instead of using the default

Sawtooth wave switch to one of the pulse waves next in the filter Bank section increase the amount of filter bands to 40 and maximize its frequency range this gives us most accurate results when we re resynthesize the modulator signal then turn up the envelope depth to 120% and select LR mode this allows the device to process both carrier and modulator in Stereo the key to achieving such latexy rubbery texture is to modulate the F out of the coarse tuning slider of the the monophonic [Music] oscillator to automate this process

along with other parameters let us bring in five lfos under the max for Life tab to avoid confusion label them in chronological order next adjust their waveform form rate and smooth to the following setting if you are on any older versions of Ableton Live you may substitute waveform stray with random lastly with the new Ableton 12 update LFO along with other Maxs for live devices such as expression control envelope follow shaper Etc now offers modulation mode where we can apply modulations onto parameters without

taking over them completely however from the few experiments I have conducted I have encountered a couple bugs and hiccups that rendered it unreliable on my end so to keep things simple we will instead be strictly using remote mode in this tutorial now apply lfo1 onto vocoder 1's oscillation to pitch next apply lfo2 onto forant and lf3 onto envelope attack time then adjust LFO 3's maximum modulation value to 20% the amount is minuscule but I found that even a couple millisecs of attack time

adds a lot to the screeching after that map lf4 onto vocoder envelope release time as this is a monophonic oscillator too long of a Decay time would get in the way way of the next detected pitch so we ought to keep this short by adjusting the maximum modulation value to 45% lastly map lf5 onto filter bandwidth obviously this adjusts the bandwidth of each band pass filter narrower bands emphasize on a smaller range of frequencies creating a chime like or comb filter-like texture while wider bands overlap with neighboring bands

creating a slightly noisier sound [Music] before we take a listen to what we have right now let's give it a bit of Ott as well as we will be running our signal through another system of vocoders it wouldn't be a bad idea to make sure it's loud and compressed [Music] it ain't much yet but we'll get there in no time next we are going to duplicate our signal and process them with two new chains of vocoders in parallel bring in a new vocoder and name it vocoder 2 group it into an audio effect rack label

it as audio effect rack one lastly duplicate the vocoder 2 Chain and rename the copy as vocoder 3 now let us first set up vocoder two select pitch tracking mode then initialize these following parameters finally turn up envelope depth to around 170% this parameter decides how much of the modulator amplitude envelope is applied onto the carrier depending on what you picked as your modulator signal you may need to fine-tune this parameter down the road now jump over to vocoder 3 rather than using pitch tracking mode

again we instead are going to utilize Ableton VOC coder's internal noise engine as the carrier signal with the right configuration vocoder 3 will play a supplementary yet important role in adding bright colorful harmonics to our main sound first toggle enhance then increase the amount of filter bands to the maximum 40 as for filter frequency range set the upper band to Max but limit the lower band at 500 htz this is to avoid introducing low frequency rumbles that might not be suitable for our

context next turn envelope depth all the way up to 195% then switch to Mono mode then increase forment to eight and lower envelope release time to 15 milliseconds lastly max out both unvoiced and sensitivity parameter the former adjusts the volume of an additional noise generator used to resynthesize portions of the modulator signal that are pitchess such as cences like S and F sound meanwhile the sensitivity slider sets how reactive the unvoiced detection algorithm is with it being all the way up at 100% the noise

generator is constantly on next similar to vocoder 1 we will be modulating various parameters on both vocoder 2 and three with lfos surely we can reuse the five lfos we brought in earlier but in order to get the most unpredictable results let us bring in some new ones drag in five new lfos and name them chronolog locally same as lfo1 to5 we'll be strictly using remote mode then initialize them to the following setting Now map lf6 onto vood 2's course tuning although it sounds really good as

is I find lower pitches more captivating as they show off the grainy visceral nature of the monophonic oscillator so is there a way for us to skew the probability so that there's a higher chance of lf6 outputting a value below 50% while retaining full modulation range on Voda 2's course tuning the answer is yes but that takes some tinkering on LFO 6's offset and depth parameter let me demonstrate with a s LFO and a random LFO by mapping random LFO onto s lfo's offset and capping the

maximum modulation value at 50% we do be greatly increasing the probability of s LFO outputting a value below 50% however the catch is that any value below 0% is flattened at obviously 0% in other words we are merely increasing the probability of hitting 0% so this is when depth comes into play we want to modulate it simultaneously so that the LFO adjusts itself to stay within range sorry for the long- winded yapping session I hope I am not making this any more complicated than it has to be now

back to lf6 Simply map lf7 onto LFO 6's offset and depth then adjust their minimum and maximum modulation value to the following next map lf8 and lf9 onto Voda 2's envelope attack and release respectively then lower the max modulation value on attack to 15% and 55% on release afterwards map LFO 10 onto Voda 2's bandwidth and increase the minimum modulation value to around 40% in order to avoid sharp resonances of narrow filter bands lastly grab any one of the lfos that is not lfo2 and map it onto

vocoder 2's formant as for vocoder 3 we are going to keep it simple as spoilers we will be controlling it mostly through macros similar to Voda 2's forant grab one of the existing lfos and map it onto Voda 3's bandwidth then increase the minimum modulation value to [Music] [Music] 40% it's slowly coming together now boys that's that for core components now we can finally move on to macro macros and effects for macro 1 2 and 3 we will be using them like a mini mixer to control

the level of three vital chains within our system first being the wet signal chain where all Voda Shenanigans take place second being the parallel dry signal and third being the vocoder 3 chain which I mentioned before adds color and harmonics to the Voda conglomerate let's start off by grouping everything we have except the limiter in into an audio effect rack and label it as audio effect rack 2 then rename our effect chain to plastic factory and under it create a new empty chain and name it

dry after that navigate to Audio effect rack 1 and map Voda 3's chain volume onto macro 1 Now map the chain volume of plastic factory dry and voder 3 onto macro 1 2 and three respectively and label them accordingly I highly recommend going into macro's mapping Tab and limit the maximum chain volume to Z DB it's a personal pet peeve of mine I'm just not a fan of seeing Channel and chain volume going above zero DB but girl you do you despite deploying a large amount of random lfos our system has remained

rigid and closely knitted so for macro 4 I want to create a knob that mutates our sound into something vastly different and is fun to play with navigate to the Ableton browser look for a grain delay preset called Borg and place it behind vocoder 2 grain delay deserves its own video in the future so I won't be diving deep into it today simply turn feedback down to around 25% and map lf7 onto pitch to randomize it now here's the fun part map the dry wet of B Voda 2's envelope depth vood 3's

envelope depth and Voda 3's formant all onto macro two of audio effect rack one and label it fragment then go to the macros mapping Tab and adjust their minimum and maximum value to the following lastly simply map fragment onto macro 4 of our main rack [Music] [Music] moving on to spatial processing obviously this is not an Uncharted Territory in sound design however when it comes to creating hyperrealistic sounds there are two effortless tricks that can make your sound more Vivid and Lively at the end of plastic factory

chain insert another grain delay switch to time based delay mode then turn down the delay time all the way to 1 millisecond next turn up spray to somewhere around 6 to 12 milliseconds and turn down frequency to around 1.5 to 2 Hertz at last bring feedback all the way up to 90% to control it map grain delays dry wet on to macro 5 and call it metal [Music] [Music] Splendid the second go-to effect of mine would be hybrid Reverb insert it right after our metallic grain delay then turn down pre delay to 2

milliseconds next under the routing drop-down menu select convolution mode this turns off the algorithmic Reverb as we need only the convolution Reverb engine now go to the convolution IR section under early reflection select synagogue wide LR lastly turn down the size of the impulse response to 25% not only does this shorten the Reverb tail but also speeds up and pitches up the impulse response resulting in a discombobulating effect as if the sound comes deep inside from our nogin to control it we are going to

Simply map dry wet onto macro 6 and label it space we are basically done however there are still a couple housekeeping items we cannot just Goof Off willy-nilly as we are going to add the dry signal back into the mix We ought to glue them together nicely outside audio effect rack 2 bring in Ott eq8 and saturator then finally group everything including the limiter together into a new audio effect rack relocate all the macros we previously created onto the new rack then map Ott's dry wet onto macro 7 and

saturator drive onto macro 8 fiddle with the EQ as you please and Bone Apple teeth plastic factory [Music] [Music] you w [Music] [Music] under [Music] that's it for today thank you for sticking around till the end and I really appreciate everyone for giving me your precious time this video took a while to make so I really hope you have gained something from it and had fun in the process I'm glad that you find this Sonic hyperrealism project interesting and I'm aiming to make many more this

project is greatly inspired by artists such as Sophie umu pet Supply himera and many many more without their works I wouldn't be here doing what I'm doing and I'll be foreverly grateful for being exposed to this lineage of phenomenal artists so go stream their music see their live shows and performances learn about what they stand for as artists support them in any shape or form stay hydrated I love you
